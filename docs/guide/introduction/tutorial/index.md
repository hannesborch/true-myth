# Tutorial

<em>A gentle introduction to the types and concepts in True Myth.</em>

When you have finished reading this tutorial, you should know:

- How to use `Maybe` instead of `null` or `undefined`.
- How to use `Result` instead of exceptions.
- How to use `Task`s instead of `Promise`s.

For each type, you will also have seen a few examples of some of the most common helpers methods each type provides.

You probably want to read these in order, as they build on each other!

:::tip Heads up!

This is *not* an exhaustive deep dive on every part of the library. There are *lots* more examples in [the API docs](/api/), and deep dives in [the Understanding section](/guide/understanding/). The goal here is just to get you going with the basics!
