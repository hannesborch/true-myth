# index

This is just here to re-export [Maybe](../maybe/classes/Maybe.md), [Result](../result/classes/Result.md), [Task](../task/classes/Task.md),
[Unit](../unit/variables/Unit.md), and [Toolbelt](../toolbelt/index.md), to provide a root-level entry friendly to
using with Node with TypeScript versions before 4.7 and its ESM support, as
well as for general convenience.
