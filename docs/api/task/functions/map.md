# Function: map()

## Call Signature

> **map**\<`T`, `U`, `E`\>(`mapFn`): (`task`) => [`Task`](../classes/Task.md)\<`U`, `E`\>

Auto-curried, standalone function form of
[`Task.prototype.map`](../classes/Task.md#map).

> [!TIP]
> The auto-curried version is provided for parity with the similar functions
> that the `Maybe` and `Result` modules provide. However, like `Result`, you
> will likely find that this form is somewhat difficult to use, because
> TypeScriptâ€™s type inference does not support it well: you will tend to end
> up with an awful lot of `unknown` unless you write the type parameters
> explicitly at the call site.
>
> The non-curried form will not have that problem, so you should prefer it.
