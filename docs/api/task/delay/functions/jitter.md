# Function: jitter()

> **jitter**(`n`): `number`

Apply fully random jitter proportional to the number passed in. The resulting
value will never be larger than 2Ã—n, and never less than 0.

This is useful for making sure your retries generally follow a given
[`Strategy`](../interfaces/Strategy.md), but if multiple tasks start at the same time, they do
not all retry at exactly the same time.

## Parameters

### n

`number`

The value to apply random jitter to.

## Returns

`number`
